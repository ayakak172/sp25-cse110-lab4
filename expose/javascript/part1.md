1. values added: 20
2. final result: 20
3. var should not be used because it may cause naming conflicts and cause excessive storage use. There are no conflicts in this scenario, but for more complex functions, the name "result" could have been used for a different variable and naming conflicts could have occurred.
4. values added: 20
5. The code would return an error because the variable "result" does not exist outside of the if loop.
6. The code would return an error because the variable "result" is a constant, meaning that it cannot be reassigned any value.
7. The code would return an error because the variable result does not exist outside of the if loop, meaning that it is trying to access a variable that does not exist.
